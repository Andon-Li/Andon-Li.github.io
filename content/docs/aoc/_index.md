# Advent Of Code
Hi! These pages are designed to be a learning for both me and you!

In the problem section, I will strip away most of the Christmas themed story and leave just the coding problem.
In the insights section, I will detail some key points about each challenge.
They might include important edge cases.
These points will be useful to keep in mind while developing a solution.
In the solutions section, I will provide several solutions, including my own, to study and compare to. I believe that there is never exactly one way to code a solution. Thus, many solutions will give you a general idea on how to solve a problem.
