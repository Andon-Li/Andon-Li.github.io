# Advent Of Code
Hi! These pages are designed to be a learning for both me and you! 
In the problem section, I will strip away the christmas themed story and leave just the problem.

In the solutions section, I will provide several solutions, including my own, to study and compare to. I believe that there is never exactly one way to code a solution. Thus, many solutions will give you a general idea on how to solve a problem.
