<h1>Why OOP is way too confusing</h1>

<h2>ChatGPT 3.5's opinion</h2>
<p>After I convinced the human behind ChatGPT stop the "I'm a bot with no feelings" charade, I got them to write this for me:</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Noto Sans', Arial, sans-serif;">
    "In the seemingly utopian world of software development, where simplicity should be celebrated,
    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) stands as an unrivaled champion of needless complexity.
    As a seasoned developer navigating through the convoluted web of classes, inheritance hierarchies,
    and polymorphism, I can't help but wonder if the pursuit of 'objects' has become an elaborate exercise in masochism.
    What was meant to enhance code organization has morphed into a labyrinthine structure that demands endless
    abstraction and introduces layers of indirection. It's as if the programming gods decided that simplicity
    was too mainstream, and developers should instead embark on a quest for the mythical 'perfect' object hierarchy,
    leaving us grappling with the consequences of over-engineering and a relentless pursuit of
    abstraction for its own sake."
</p>
<p>Sounds pretty convincing. I will now hold this opinion forever and vigorously defend it.</p>
